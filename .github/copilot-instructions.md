# GitHub Copilot Instructions for RimWorld Modding Project

## Mod Overview and Purpose
The "Crystal Ball" mod for RimWorld introduces an enchanting new feature to the game world, allowing players to engage in scrying activities using a mystical crystal ball. The pinnacle of this mod is the `Building_CrystalBallTable`, where pawns can predict future events, potentially altering the course of gameplay by providing forewarning of upcoming incidents.

## Key Features and Systems

- **Scrying Mechanics**: 
  - The `Building_CrystalBallTable` class handles the core scry functions with methods such as `GetCurrentProgress()`, `PerformScryWork()`, and `isReadyForScrying()`.
  - The `JobDriver_ScryCrystalBall` class facilitates the execution of the scrying job by pawns.

- **Incident Prediction and Management**:
  - `WarnedIncidentQueueWorldComponent` manages a queue of predicted events, offering methods for adding, removing, and ticking incidents.

- **User Interface**:
  - The `ITab_CrystalBallPredictions` class adds an interface tab that lets players see predicted incidents via `DrawKnownIncidentList()`.

## Coding Patterns and Conventions

- **Class Naming**: 
  - Classes are named with a clear purpose, directly indicating their role. For instance, `Building_CrystalBallTable` and `ITab_CrystalBallPredictions`.

- **Method Naming**:
  - Methods are verb-based, descriptive of their function: `AddKnownIncident()`, `PerformScryWork()`, `PredictEvents()`, etc.

- **Access Modifiers**:
  - Ensure correct usage of `public`, `internal`, and `private` to control access where necessary.

- **Event-driven Programming**:
  - Utilize specific methods in classes like `WarnedIncidentQueueWorldComponent` to respond to game world events efficiently.

## XML Integration

While there isn't explicit XML content summarized here, a typical process includes:

- **Defining new objects and jobs** in XML files using `<Defs>` sections.
- **Integrating C# code** with XML by matching method functionality to XML tags such as `<WorkGiver>`, `<Job>`, and defining related criteria.

## Harmony Patching

- **HarmonyPatches Class**: 
  - This class should host all Harmony patches necessary to modify the existing game logic non-destructively. Follow principles of being minimally invasive, focusing on `Postfix`, `Prefix`, `Transpilers`, and `Finalizer` as needed.
  
- **Best Practices**: 
  - Use Harmony to hook into methods where mod functionality needs to change or extend base game behavior without altering core files.

## Suggestions for Copilot

1. **Generate Code Stubs**:
   - Use Copilot to create initial stubs for methods and classes by entering descriptive comments.

2. **XML Code Generation**:
   - Prompt generation of XML snippets based on C# code components for seamless integration between XML definitions and C# methods.

3. **Harmony Integration**:
   - Suggest full Harmony hooks by starting patterns with `Harmony.PatchAll()` or targeting specific methods using `var harmonyInstance = new Harmony("modname.id");`.

4. **Fixing Common Bugs**:
   - Utilize Copilot to catch and suggest fixes for common issues like incorrect type casting or off-by-one errors in loops.

5. **Interface Elements**:
   - Draft new UI components and integrate these with game logic using class methods with Copilotâ€™s assistance.

With adherence to these guidelines and strategic use of GitHub Copilot, the development and enhancement of the "Crystal Ball" mod should be a seamless and efficient process.
